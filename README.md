# IP Replacer
Obsidian plugin for quickly replacing IPs in notes without editing your files.
### Installation
Haven't tried but I guess you just:
`git clone git@github.com:jazzpizazz/ip-replacer.git` inside of your `.obsidian/plugins/`.

### Configure
Just set your placeholder and IP:

### Only replaces in preview mode

### Notes
- Currently requires you to reopen a note after changing the settings, should be fixed
- Would be cool if you could select an interface as well instead of just entering the desired IP.
