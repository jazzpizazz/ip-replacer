# IP Replacer
Obsidian plugin for quickly replacing IPs in notes without editing your files.
### Installation
Just `git clone git@github.com:jazzpizazz/obsidian-ip-replacer.git` inside of your `.obsidian/plugins/`.

### Configure
Just create placeholders and their replacements. A replacement can be an IP, a hostname, or the name of a network interface (for example `tun0`) and the plugin
will use its IP. If the interface did not yet exist when obisidian was started you will see the name of the interface in your notes,
in that case use `Refresh Interfaces` to make the plugin recheck your interfaces.
